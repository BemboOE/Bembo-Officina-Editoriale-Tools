	abstract = {Millions of volunteers take part in clinical trials every year. This is unsurprising, given that clinical trials are often much more lucrative than other types of unskilled work. However, offering very high pay is sometimes considered ethically inappropriate. To investigate why, we asked 1,372 respondents to evaluate a hypothetical medical trial for a new Ebola vaccine offering three different payment amounts. Some individuals used very high pay as a cue to infer the potential risks a clinical a trial poses. At the same time, despite the risk they may pose, some clinical trials may be too lucrative to be turned down. Both perceived risk and coercion shape how people evaluate clinical trials; they also help explain why there is a distaste for markets in which parties are remunerated for the risk they take—that is, why markets in which health and wellbeing are turned into commodities are considered repugnant.},

	abstract = {Quiet by Susan Cain will change how you think about introverts {foreverA} Sunday Times and New York Times {BestsellerOur} lives are driven by a fact that most of us can't name and don't understand. It defines who our friends and lovers are, which careers we choose, and whether we blush when we're embarrassed.That fact is whether we're an introvert or an extrovert.The introvert/extrovert divide is the most fundamental dimension of personality. And at least a third of us are on the introverted side. Some of the world's most talented people are introverts. Without them we wouldn't have the Apple computer, the theory of relativity and Van Gogh's sunflowers.Yet extroverts have taken over. Shyness, sensitivity and seriousness are often seen as being negative. Introverts feel reproached for being the way they are.In Quiet, Susan Cain shows how the brain chemistry of introverts and extroverts differs, and how society misunderstands and undervalues introverts. She gives introverts the tools to better understand themselves and take full advantage of their strengths.Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with real stories, Quiet will permanently change how we see introverts - and how you see yourself.'I can't get Quiet out of my head. It is an important book - so persuasive and timely and heartfelt it should inevitably effect change in schools and offices' Jon Ronson, The Guardian 'Susan Cain's Quiet has sparked a quiet revolution. In our booming culture, hers is a still, small voice that punches above its weight. Perhaps rather than sitting back and asking people to speak up, managers and company leaders might lean forward and listen' Megan Walsh, The Times 'Quiet is a very timely book, and Cain's central thesis is fresh and important. Maybe the extrovert ideal is no longer as powerful as it was; perhaps it is time we all stopped to listen to the still, small voice of calm' Daisy Goodwin, The Sunday Times Susan Cain is the owner of The Negotiation Company, a firm that trains people in negotiation and communication skills.  Her clients include Merrill Lynch, Standard \& Poor, University of Chicago Business School and many of the {US}'s most powerful law firms.

First published by Sigmund Freud in 1899, The Interpretation of Dreams considers why we dream and what it means in the larger picture of our psychological lives. Delving into theories of manifest and latent dream content, the special language of dreams, dreams as wish fulfillments, the significance of childhood experiences, and much more, Freud, widely considered the father of psychoanalysis," thoroughly and thoughtfully examines dream psychology. Encompassing dozens of case histories and detailed analyses of actual dreams, this landmark text presents Freud's legendary work as a tool for comprehending our sleeping experiences. Renowned for translating Freud's German writings into English, James Strachey,with the assistance of Anna Freud,first published this edition in 1953.

The book is edited by Professor Jamie Hacker Hughes, a former head of healthcare psychology within the {UK} Ministry of Defence and all contributors are experts in policy, service provision and academic research in this area.

For the nurse specifically, this means educating and working alongside parents and children within an environment that supports health. Consistent with client- and family-centered practice, this fresh approach to nurse/client teaching is drawn a broad span of disciplines, including education, social and cultural anthropology, relationship-based attachment-caregiving theory, and developmental science.Written for students and practitioners who wish to incorporate {GP} into their practice, and for managers, administrators, and policy makers who support its implementation, this resource demonstrates the value of {GP} as a new and emerging health care model that integrates care across health care settings. The text describes, step-by-step, how to practice {GP} discusses support systems to maintain {GP} past the initial treatment. With abundant case studies, examples and research findings, chapters analyze how {GP} can promote health, prevent acute and chronic illness, and adjust old patterns of living and behaviors.Key Features:Includes video clips that illustrate how guided participation is applied in a variety of clinical practice {settingsProvides} access to self-directed online {instructionLinks} to online journal, case studies, additional chapters, and {referencesFeatures} downloadable parent checklists and teaching {guidesDiscusses} effective application of Guided Participation to all aspects of pediatric nursing care in a variety of practice {settingsIncludes} numerous case studies and examples with specific components identified to help readers learn theory and related {conceptsLearn} to apply guided participation by joining the case-based online course offered at University of Wisconsin-Madison!},

	shorttitle = {Thinking in Systems},
	abstract = {In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller, Limits to Growththe first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001.Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institutes Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life.Some of the biggest problems facing the worldwar, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradationare essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking.While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner.In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.},
